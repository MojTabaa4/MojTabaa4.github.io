Greetings! My name is **Mojtaba Abtahi**, and I am a graduate of
the [University of Tehran](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-tehran-504903){: onclick="gtag('event', 'click', {'event_category': 'UniRank Link', 'event_label': 'UoT'});"}
with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering, achieving a cumulative GPA of 3.91 out of 4.0 scale, with a perfect GPA of
4/4 in the last two academic years.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong proficiency in Python and its associated libraries and
frameworks, which encompassed NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. These skills were put to
practical use in numerous projects involving **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **natural language processing**, and **software
development**. Some of the applications I worked on included object detection, machine translation, text summarization,
text classification, and sentiment analysis.

As a Software Engineer at Snappfood, I designed and developed software solutions by analyzing user requirements, system
performance, and data usage. I also have relevant coursework in software engineering and testing.

I am deeply passionate about engaging in research, exemplified by my active participation in two projects centered
around sentiment analysis and chatbot development.
