Greetings! My name is **Mojtaba Abtahi**, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
Engineering at the University of Tehran, achieving a cumulative GPA of 3.91 out of 4.0 scale, with a perfect GPA of 4/4
in the last two academic years.

As a research assistant, I had the privilege to collaborate with my supervisors on a project that involved sentiment
analysis of Amazon clothing product reviews, where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning and natural language
processing techniques. Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken several projects that challenged me to solve
real-world problems using various programming languages and tools.

Furthermore, my professional experience as a Software Engineer at Snappfood company enhanced my understanding of
software development practices, where I designed and developed software solutions by analyzing user requirements, system
performance, and data usage. Additionally, I have taken relevant courses in **software engineering** and software
testing, which have enabled me to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical settings.

I am also passionate about reading research papers and developing my scientific writing skills. I am eager to continue
exploring the fields of **machine learning** and **natural language processing**, and I am excited to participate in
research opportunities that advance the state-of-the-art in these areas.
