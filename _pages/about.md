Greetings! My name is **Mojtaba Abtahi**, a B.Sc. Computer Engineering student at
the [University of Tehran](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-tehran-504903)
with a GPA of 3.91/4 and 4/4 in the last two years.

As a research assistant, I have worked on Amazon reviews and comments on clothes with the aid of my supervisors to
assess people's tendencies toward specific kinds of products, and I am going to use my understanding in my dissertation.

During my education, I have taken many courses about NLP and machine learning which enriched my viewpoint about
different
cutting-edge challenges in those topics, and also through my bachelor classes, I did many projects associated with
deep-learning and software engineering practical problems and solved them with various tools and languages.

These experiences give invaluable insight into my future career and motivate me to learn more about
**machine learning**, **deep learning**, **natural language processing**, and **software engineering**.

When I was working as a Software Engineer at Snappfood, I designed and developed software solutions by analyzing user
requirements through iterative cycles, system performance, and data usage in a software management methodology. I used ML
algorithms in some of my tasks and have read books in software engineering and testing.
