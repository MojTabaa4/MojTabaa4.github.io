Greetings! My name is **Mojtaba Abtahi**, and I am a graduate of
the [University of Tehran](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-tehran-504903)
with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering, achieving a cumulative GPA of 3.91 out of 4.0 scale, with a perfect GPA of
4/4 in the last two academic years.

I collaborated as a research assistant on a sentiment analysis project of Amazon clothing reviews, gaining experience in
machine learning and natural language processing. I also completed multiple real-world problem-solving projects using
various programming languages and tools during my academic journey.

Furthermore, my experience as a **Software Engineer** at Snappfood involved designing and developing software solutions
by analyzing user requirements, system performance, and data usage. I have also taken relevant courses in software
engineering and software testing.

I am also passionate about reading research papers and developing my scientific writing skills. I am eager to continue
exploring the fields of **machine learning and artificial intelligence** and **natural language processing**, and I am
excited to participate in research opportunities that advance the state-of-the-art in these areas.
